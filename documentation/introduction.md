# Getting Started (WIP)
* Note: This project is designed to be used with or without VR, there's no preference! I'm planning to prioritize non-vr users in future updates though.
* You can install LGE into your lovr project by inserting ``lovr_graphics_engine`` into your project directory.
* LGE can then be included in any script using:
```lua
local LGE = require "lovr_graphics_engine.include"
```
