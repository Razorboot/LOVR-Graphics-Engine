# LOVR Object-Oriented Graphics Engine
* Custom graphics engine for LOVR using Object Oriented Programming.
  * This includes a Scene system which holds objects called Nodes.
  * Nodes can have attachments applied to them such as models and lights.
  * Nodes have a transformation applied to them. All models and lights will have their transformation set as an offset from this core node transformation.
* Documentation is a WIP.
* Keep in mind as of December 31st, 2022, this is meant to be executed using LOVR nightly builds, you will unfortunately encounter bugs in other versions.
* Big thanks to bjornbytes, j_miskov, and immortalx for all the help I recieved. Without y'all this wouldn't have been possible!
