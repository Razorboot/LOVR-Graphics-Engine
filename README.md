# LOVR Object-Oriented Graphics Engine
* Custom graphics engine for LOVR using Object Oriented Programming. This is inspired by OGRE3D's transformation system and Godot scene graphs.
* [Documentation](https://razorboot.github.io/LOVR-OOP-Graphics-Engine/documentation/introduction) is a WIP.
* Keep in mind as of December 31st, 2022, this is meant to be executed using LOVR nightly builds, you will unfortunately encounter bugs in other versions.
* This project is designed to be used with or without VR, there's no preference! I'm planning to prioritize non-vr users in future updates though.
* This project wouldn't have been possible without bjornbytes, j_miskov, and immortalx!
